                It is a personality explorer psychometric assessment tool that
                helps individuals understand their preferences, strengths, and
                areas for growth. Developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine
                Cook Briggs, the MBTI categorizes individuals into 16
                personality types based on four dichotomies. The goal is to gain
                deeper self-awareness, enhance personal development, and improve
                interpersonal relationships
